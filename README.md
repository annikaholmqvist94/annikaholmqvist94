## Current Focus: Full-Stack ATS Application

I am currently architecting a professional Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that demonstrates the full lifecycle of modern software development—from secure backend logic to automated cloud deployment and real-time candidate management.

![ATS Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8ab73c1-be21-46bb-bcab-dec68db06894)

* **Backend:** Java & Spring Boot with **Supabase JWT Authentication (ES256)** for robust, token-based security.
* **Database:** **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** with Row Level Security and RESTful API integration.
* **DevOps:** Fully automated deployment using **Railway CLI** (backend) and **Vercel** (frontend).
* **Frontend:** Modern, responsive UI built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** featuring drag-and-drop pipeline management.
* **Key Features:** Candidate management, recruitment pipeline with drag-and-drop stages, detailed scorecards, admin user management, and role-based access control.
