## Current Focus: Full-Stack Invoicing System
I am currently architecting a professional invoicing application that demonstrates the full lifecycle of modern software development—from secure backend logic to automated cloud deployment.

* **Backend:** Java & Spring Boot with **Spring Security + JWT** for robust authentication.
* **Database:** **Azure SQL (MSSQL)** managed via JPA/Hibernate.
* **DevOps:** Fully automated CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** for seamless deployment to **Azure App Service**.
* **Frontend:** Modern, responsive UI built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.
